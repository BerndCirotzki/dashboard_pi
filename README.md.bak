colour dashboard Plugin for OpenCPN 
-----------------------------------

this Plugin is the original taken code from OpenCPN main code dashboard_pi and works in same way.
the code has been expanded to create a separate design for each instrument.
The following settings are now possible:
- Global changing of the colors and sizes for the fonts.
- additional button "Edit" to change the following for each instrument individually:
  - Fonts
  - Font sizes
  - Font colors
  - Background colors
  - Arrow colors (if available.)
  
  Windows:
  compile the code, create the installation package and install it to OpenCPN.
  This will replace the dashbord_pi.dll file.
  Build as normally:

    cd ..
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install  
  
  (could not test with other OS, but I think, it will work as same.)
  
  or copy all files from "src" and "include" to opencpn/plugins/dashboard_pi/src
  change in dashboard_pi.h :
  #include "nmea0183.h" to
  #include "nnmea0183/nmea0183.h"  
  and compile OpenCPN.
